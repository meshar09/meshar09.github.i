    <p>Affiliate marketing is the process by which an affiliate earns a commission for marketing another person’s or company’s products. The affiliate simply searches for a product they enjoy, then promotes that product and earns a piece of the profit from each sale they make. The sales are tracked via affiliate links from one website to another. </p>

    <h3 style="color:#0a60e0">TYPE OF AFFILIATE MARKETING</h3>
    <p>There are three main types of Affiliate Marketing but there are also hybrids of these three models in the market. These three types are</p>:<br><br>
    <p>Related Affiliate Marketing: This is where you already have an online store and you use Affiliate Marketing to gain passive income through selling related products from other stores. An example would be if you sell cushions for couches and beds, you could sell cushion covers on your website that will fit your products but are sold by someone else.</p>
    <p>Unrelated Affiliate Marketing:Again when you have your own store you might want to branch out and can use Affiliate Marketing to test new products. Using unrelated Affiliate Marketing you can gain passive income and if the test proves fruitless you would not have lost any money.</p>
    <p>Pure Affiliate Marketing: Pure Affiliate Marketing is when you have no online store of your own but you market someone else’s products through other marketing channels like a blog, social media, email marketing, etc. Pure Affiliate Marketing is most present in influencer marketing where influential people, known for their knowledge in a certain niche, will act as an ambassador for a product or brand and market the offering to their audience.</p>

    <h4 style="color:#0a60e0">WHAT IS AN AFFILIATE PROGRAM</h4><br>
    <p>An affiliate program is a campaign set up by a company who sells products, whereby they agree to pay commission for any traffic or sales on their website that third-party affiliate marketers provide. The traffic or sales will come from individual websites that talk about the products and promotes them to their audience. Amazon’s affiliate program is a well-known and very popular affiliate program across the world.</p>
